Implementing a simple identifier for all satoshis : RFC (Request for Comment)

This can also be known as a Satoshi Code.

Overview
Satoshi Codes can show up after the "Rare & exotic sat" status.

Layout
The following layout shows how Satoshi Codes can be implemented:

Example: 
B1y1we1c0; 2009 Ox 🐂🔥 🚪
B30000y2we1: 2010 tiger 🐯🔥 
B60000y3we1: 2011 rabbit 🐰🔥 
B90000y4h1we2rd1: 🐲⚡️🌀🏆 

B = satoshi block number mined on bitcion
y = year block mined
we = wave edition (each four years before the halving is a wave)
h1 = halving
rd = reward decrease

We can add smbols like the Chinese zodiac symbol and element at the end to denote specific years.
As well as 🌀for halving event and 🏆 for reward decreases.
The first block can have a 🛎️ to signal the inception event. 
The first year can have a 🚪to signal a new path being forged.
the last block & last year can have a 💥 or a 🌌 to symbolize a big bang event or a simultaneous multi-occurrence that transforms into whatever is next...

Objectives
Provide a simple code to search and etch ordinals like trading card packs.
Allow the community to use this and show new comers how to read the bitcoin public ledger.
Allows ordinals to be easily located.

Solution
Release this improvement within the existing ORD ecosystem.
